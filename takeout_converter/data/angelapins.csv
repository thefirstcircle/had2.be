Angela,"American chestnut trees on campus!! The story of the American chestnut is my “Roman empire”, this tree used to dominate northeastern forests till a blight came through in the beginning of the 19th century. It was a source of hardwood for building and a major source of carbohydrates for the American diet. But the blight came through and wiped out the trees. Now they are still around, but cannot reach maturity before the chestnut blight hits them and their bark splits and they get stunted. ","https://www.google.com/maps/search/42.3953101,-72.5227633",
